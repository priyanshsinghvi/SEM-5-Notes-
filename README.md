# Semester 5 Notes Hub

Welcome to the Semester 5 Notes Repository – your one-stop destination for all the study materials you didn’t know you needed (or maybe you did, but who’s asking).

## How to Use

### Download as ZIP
1. Hit the green "Code" button at the top.
2. Select "Download ZIP" (yes, it's that easy).
3. Extract the ZIP file wherever you want (no judgment here).

- Each subject gets its own directory (because who doesn't love organization?)
- Inside each unit, you'll find PDFs with notes and study materials to make you look like you actually paid attention in class.

## Extra Help: The Ultimate YouTube Channel for Automation & Math
If your professors aren’t making sense (surprise, surprise), check out [Akash Kumar's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AkashKumar-oct-27). He explains automata and math in a way that actually sticks – much better than the usual “just memorize this” nonsense. It’s like having a teacher who actually gets it.
